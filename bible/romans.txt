Romans 2: 4-16
1. Gentiles do not have the outer law, but they do have the inner law. 
2. Conscience bears witness (accuse/excuse them)
3. Gospel - God judges our secrets - by(through?) Jesus

(ESV)
14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. 15 They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them 16 on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.

(Chinese New Version)
14 沒有律法的外族人，如果按本性行律法上的事，他們雖然沒有律法，自己就是自己的律法； 15 這就表明律法的作用是刻在他們的心裡，有他們的良心一同作證，他們的思想互相較量，或作控告、或作辯護。 16 這也要照著我所傳的福音，在　神藉著耶穌基督審判各人隱情的那一天，彰顯出來。
