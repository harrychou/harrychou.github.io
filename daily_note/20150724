Paul Krugman's article
- MIT gang
	http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/opinion/paul-krugman-the-mit-gang.html
	- MIT economists are right
	- but why do the politicians still not doing the right thing
	- group thinkings? some kind of team/group dynamics in play?

Matt Johnson's series of articles
- All things in time
	- http://codeofmatt.com/2012/03/29/all-things-in-time/
	- most db and system only capture what is current and ignore the history
	- we don't know how current states get to how things are
	- just adding DateCreated, DateUpdated does not solve the problem
	- temporal patterns

		http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/Effectivity.html
		http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/TemporalObject.html
	- bi-temporal issues in db
	- problem with query efficiency from db
		http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17637/Bitemporal-Database-Table-Design-The-Basics
	- so, a temporal concern is an architectural concern, and should be considered for the whole system
		* UI
		* domain model
		* storage
		* messaging
		* services/API ... etc
	- alternative ways to think about the problem can help reduce the complexity
		* CQRS
		* Event Sourcing
	- capture 'what you do' (commands and events at specific time) not only 'the result of what you do'
