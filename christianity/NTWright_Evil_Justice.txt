Preface
=========================
  - Why writing this book?
    * handling the problem and question of 'evil' as necessary preparation for 'Resurrection' book
    * respond to Setember 11, 2001 - the world respond with simplistic view (axis of evil (Bush), rid the world of evil (Blair)), what should Christianity respond?
  - started as lectures and TV program
  - not meant to be a comprehensive answer (not even full treatment of Jesus' death and resurrection)
  - natural disasters, ... 
  - the problem of 'evil' is not something we will "solve" in the present world
  - our primary task is not give answers - our task is to bring signs of God's new world to birth on the basis of Jesus' death and in the power of his Spirit

=========================
1. Evil is Still a Four-Letter Word: The New Problem of Evil
=========================
  Sea as metaphor of 'evil' in Bible
  - There will be no 'sea' in new heaven and new earth
  - 'Sea' is part of creation - is 'very good'
  - Noah - sea/water as a sign of chaos to enact God's work
  - Moses - water/sea to punish pagan force
  - Ps 29:10 - God is king over the flood
  - God controls the water/sea.
  - Daniel 7: monsters came out from sea (四個大獸從海中上來)
    (sea as representative of evil)
  Sea just like evil is a force that is out there, and within us
  9-11 and the response: taken by surprise, why?
  God/Christian needs to address two kinds of evil: naturla evil, moral evil
  Agenda:
    1. evil and how it appears in temporary culture
    2/3. evil in OT and NT (cross of Jesus)
    4. new way to speak about evil, what Christian can do about it
      evil of global empire, of criminal justice/punishment, of war
    5. forgiveness and evil
  For this chapter:
    - Politician/Media normally ignore the problem of evil
    - util evil wakes us up and we hastly respond to it
    - postmodernity (as new way to address evil) are deficient in important ways
    - we need new ways to think about evil

The New Problem of Evil
  Why 'new' problem of evil: 
    - we treat problem of evil traditionally as question of metaphsical/thelogical problems
    - modernity treated evil with mindset of progressive thinking (we may encounter problmes, but we make progress)
      * two world wars and Nazi as a wake-up call, but still the idea of progressiveness survived
      * we still think democracy can solve problems, and also things will get better
    - the problem of modernity's attitude towards 'evil'
      1. we ignore 'evil' when it is not hitting us in the face
        even in age of globalization, we tell us to ignore problem of 'evils' until it is too late, or reported
      2. we are surprised by eveil when it hits us by surprise
        genocide, terrorism
      3. we react immaturily and in dangerous way to appear to 'fix/correct/compensate' it
        child-abuse, 9-11
        identifying or labeling something as 'evil' hides the problem of evil
        we can not eliminate evil by politics or just weapons/violence
        we cast blames (other's fault, government's fault, al-queda's fault)
        or we blame ourselves (we caused evil, evil is within us, we need to correct ourselves first)
    - "the culture of blaming everyone else, and the culture of blaming oneself (resuting in depression and moral/social paralysis) are likewise immature and inadequate.
    - so, this is a 'new' problem and we are don't have a good way to address it
    - ignore it is not an option

The New Nihilism: Postmodernity
  - postmodernity avoid the problem of 'identity', hence no one is responsible for problem of evil
  - we still face the problem of evil, but we can only say 'it's complicated'
  - "nothing will get better, and there is nothing we can do about it" attitude
  - Epictetur （愛比克泰德) 
  - postmodernity should be welcomed, it 'deconstructs' the dangerous ideology of 'progress'
  - two problems if post-modernists
    * postmodernity is 'dehumanizing'
      no moral dignity
      ignore that humanbeings are responsible agent
      it's not fair for victims if we just say we can't do anything about it
    * allows for no redemption
      no way out, no need for repentence and restoration
      no way back to truth
      "they recognize the problem, but offers no solution"
Toward a Nuanced View of Evil
  - other major worldviews
    buddist: the present world is an illusion and we should try to escape it
      * platonism, even Plato concerns about justice and stuff
    Hindu: eveil in present life are to be explained in terms of wrongs committed in previous life and one should work out his Karma
      * deeply satisfying at one level, but problematic in another
    Marxist
      * world is moving toward dictartorship ofthe proletariat
      * we need revolution to rectify it for final result
    Muslim
      * world is messy because the message of Allah through Muhammad has not yet spread out to all people
      * either through peaceful process (majority view) or through jihad
    Christian(Jewish) view?
      * to be addressed later
      * three elements
        - recognize the flaw in assuming the western democracy
          * illusion of US rules
          * Churchill 'democracy is the worst possible form of government, except for all other other forms that are tried from time to time' ...
          * democracy doesn't solve the problem of 'evil'
        - recognize some psychnological illness may has something to do with 'evil'
          * it is possible for humans to be taken over by evil, to belive lies and to live by it
          * recognize the 'human evil' and its various form
          * 'People of the Lie' Peck: there is such a force or forces of evil which is capable of taking over humans as individuals or as society as a whole
          * Walter Wink's book on Power reminds us the force that turn people/organization into evil
        (democracy, science, modernity, global econom, ... etc)
